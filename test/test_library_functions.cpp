// Step 1. Include necessary header files such that the stuff your
// test logic needs is declared.
//
// Don't forget gtest.h, which declares the testing framework.

#include <example2.h>
#include "gtest/gtest.h"
#include <stdio.h>

// Step 2. Use the TEST macro to define your tests.
//
// TEST has two parameters: the test case name and the test name.
// After using the macro, you should define your test logic between a
// pair of braces.  You can use a bunch of macros to indicate the
// success or failure of a test.  EXPECT_TRUE and EXPECT_EQ are
// examples of such macros.  For a complete list, see gtest.h.
//
// <TechnicalDetails>
//
// In Google Test, tests are grouped into test cases.  This is how we
// keep test code organized.  You should put logically related tests
// into the same test case.
//
// The test case name and the test name should both be valid C++
// identifiers.  And you should not use underscore (_) in the names.
//
// Google Test guarantees that each test you define is run exactly
// once, but it makes no guarantee on the order the tests are
// executed.  Therefore, you should write your tests in such a way
// that their results don't depend on their order.

// Tests Factorial().

// Tests factorial of negative numbers.
TEST(FactorialTest, Negative) {
    // This test is named "Negative", and belongs to the "FactorialTest"
    // test case.
    std::cout << "The value of sqrt_wrapper(4) is " << sqrt_wrapper(4) << std::endl;
    EXPECT_EQ(sqrt_wrapper(4), 2);
    
    // <TechnicalDetails>
    //
    // EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual) is the same as
    //
    //   EXPECT_TRUE((expected) == (actual))
    //
    // except that it will print both the expected value and the actual
    // value when the assertion fails.  This is very helpful for
    // debugging.  Therefore in this case EXPECT_EQ is preferred.
    //
    // On the other hand, EXPECT_TRUE accepts any Boolean expression,
    // and is thus more general.
